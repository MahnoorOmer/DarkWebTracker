# 🕵️‍♀️ DarkWebTracer – Keyword Intelligence in the Shadows

_"Because some secrets hide where the sun doesn't shine..."_

DarkWebTracer is a cybersecurity intelligence tool that monitors, searches, and alerts users when specific **keywords** appear on the **dark web**. It's designed to assist analysts and organizations in tracking sensitive leaks, compromised credentials, and emerging cyber threats.

## 🧠 What It Does

- 🌐 Crawls and scrapes **.onion** sites and underground forums
- 🔍 Searches for **monitored keywords** tied to user accounts
- 🚨 Generates alerts with **threat type**, **risk level**, and **timestamp**
- 📊 Visualizes real-time **threat statistics** and **categories**
- 🔐 Built with user access control and encrypted data handling

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** PostgreSQL, TypeScript, Express
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js
- **Scraping Engine:** Tor proxy, Cheerio/Puppeteer
- **Authentication:** JWT, Role-based access

## 📦 Features Overview

| Feature                  | Description                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 🔑 User Roles            | Admin/User roles with access controls      |
| 🕵️ Keyword Monitoring    | Real-time keyword match tracking            |
| 📢 Alerts & Reports      | Structured alerts with threat classification|
| 📊 Dashboard Stats       | Live stats on leaks, threats, credentials  |
| 🧠 Threat Categorization | Pie charts and growth analytics by type    |

## 📌 How It Works

1. **User** adds a keyword to monitor.
2. **Scraper** traverses dark web sources via Tor and searches for those keywords.
3. If matched, an **alert** is created in the database and shown on the dashboard.
4. **Threat statistics** are updated dynamically.


## 🚧 Future Additions

- Machine Learning for risk scoring
- Telegram/email alert integrations
- Automated keyword suggestions based on user role
