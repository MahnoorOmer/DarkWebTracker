# 🕵️‍♀️ DarkWebTracer – Keyword Intelligence in the Shadows

_"Because some secrets hide where the sun doesn't shine..."_

DarkWebTracer is a cybersecurity intelligence tool that monitors, searches, and alerts users when specific **keywords** appear on the **dark web**. It's designed to assist analysts and organizations in tracking sensitive leaks, compromised credentials, and emerging cyber threats.

## 🧠 What It Does

- 🌐 Crawls and scrapes **.onion** sites and underground forums
- 🔍 Searches for **monitored keywords** tied to user accounts
- 🚨 Generates alerts with **threat type**, **risk level**, and **timestamp**
- 📊 Visualizes real-time **threat statistics** and **categories**
- 🔐 Built with user access control and encrypted data handling

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** PostgreSQL, TypeScript, Express
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js
- **Scraping Engine:** Tor proxy, Cheerio/Puppeteer
- **Authentication:** JWT, Role-based access
